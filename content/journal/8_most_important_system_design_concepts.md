## Problems
1. Read-Heavy System
2. High-Write Traffic
3. Single Point of Failure
4. High Availability
5. High Latency
6. Handling Large Files
7. Monitoring and Alerting
8. Slow Database Queries

## Solutions
1. Use caching for faster reads
2. Use async writes - Use LSM-Tree Database
3. Implement redundancy and failover
4. Use load balancing - Use replication
5. Use CDN to reduce latency
6. Use block storage and object storage
7. Use centralized logging solution
8. Use proper indexes - Use sharding to horizontally scale
